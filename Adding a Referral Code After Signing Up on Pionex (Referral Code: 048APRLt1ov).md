<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h2>Can I remove or change a submitted referral code?</h2>

No, once a referral code has been successfully submitted to your Pionex account, it cannot be removed or changed.

<h2>Why is my referral code marked as invalid?</h2>

Double-check the referral code and ensure that it is entered correctly. We recommend copying and pasting it instead of typing manually.

Your Pionex account only supports referral codes from Pionex.com. Codes from other platforms, such as Pionex.US, are not valid as they belong to separate entities.
