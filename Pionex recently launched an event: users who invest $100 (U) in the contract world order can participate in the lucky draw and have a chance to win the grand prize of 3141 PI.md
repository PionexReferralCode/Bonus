Contract world order is a trading strategy designed to cope with market volatility. By establishing both bullish and bearish contract positions, investors can profit when prices fluctuate sharply, regardless of market trends.

To participate in this event, you need to open a contract world order on the Pionex platform and ensure that the investment amount for each transaction is not less than $100. During the event, eligible traders will have the opportunity to participate in the lucky draw and win 3141 PI tokens.

Please note that contract trading is high-risk and may result in capital loss. Before participating in such transactions, it is recommended that you fully understand the relevant risks and make prudent decisions based on your own risk tolerance.
